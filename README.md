A Unity game made for the Fall 2015 UT EGaDS game jam where the them was "It Begins"

The game is split into multiple segments, with different gameplay in each segment, making it like it is beginning a new game every segment.
This repo only contains the segment that I made, where the player jumps between two walls and dodges blocks that fall from the top that
push the player down.

The goal is to last a set amount of time without getting pushed to the bottom.
